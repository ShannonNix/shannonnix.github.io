Portfolio Project

The goal of this ongoing project is to develope one page at a time using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and accessibility best practices. 
Each page will be evaluated using multiple accessibility dev tools such as; AXE, ANDI browser tool, ARC toolkit, Google Lighthouse, and WAVE. 
By completing this task, I will have a better understanding of what it takes to make a website accessbile and have a better understanding on how to code accordingly.
