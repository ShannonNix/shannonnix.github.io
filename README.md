Portfolio Project

The goal of this ongoing project is to develop one page at a time using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and accessibility best practices. 
Each page will be evaluated using multiple accessibility dev tools such as; AXE, ANDI browser tool, ARC toolkit, Google Lighthouse, and WAVE. Of course I will implement the guidelines set forth by https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/ and the information learned here https://www.dhs.gov/508-training. 
By completing this task, I will have a better understanding of what it takes to design and code a website so that it is accessible by all.
